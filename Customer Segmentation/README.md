# Customer Segmentation
A retail company has hired you. Over the last three years, the retailer has collected data about its customers, the revenue generated for different products, and the number of purchases in its different channels. Your job as a data scientist is to perform cluster analysis and identify customer clusters that can be addressed by different marketing activities (e.g., advertising, coupons).
## Tasks
1. Cluster the existing data based on appropriate procedures. 
2. Describe the clusters found based on the characteristics of the attributes of the customers and the cluster size.
3. What recommendation could you give the marketing department based on your analysis?

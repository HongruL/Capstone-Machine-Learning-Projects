# Customer Segmentation
Over the last three years, a retail company has collected data about its customers, the revenue generated for different products, and the number of purchases in its different channels. As data scientist, cluster analysis is to be performed in order to identify customer clusters that can be addressed by different marketing activities (e.g., advertising, coupons).
## Tasks
1. Cluster the existing data based on appropriate procedures. 
2. Describe the clusters found based on the characteristics of the attributes of the customers and the cluster size.
3. What recommendation could be given to the marketing department based on the analysis?

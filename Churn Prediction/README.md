# Churn Prediction
A FinTech startup that serves European customers with different financial products (e.g., banking, credit cards, ...) is currently facing some headwinds because many of the customers are leaving the FinTech. The data scientist should build a machine learning model that predicts which customers are about to leave. With this, the FinTech startup can actively engage with the identified customers and try to prevent them from leaving.

The data set contains the following attributes:

CCreditScore: The customer’s credit score
CGeography: The customer’s country of residence
CGender: The customer’s biological gender
CAge: The customer’s age
CTenure: The number of years the customer has been a registered customer
CBalance: The amount the customer has in the account
CNumOfProducts: The products they own
CHasCrCard: The status of whether the customer has a credit card
CIsActiveMember: The status of whether the customer is an active member
CEstimatedSalary: The estimated salary of the customer
Churn: The status of whether the customer churned
Apply three different simple machine learning models, and justify (based on the results) which machine learning model to choose.
Select the machine learning model chosen in task 1. Now try optimizing your results by applying the advanced concepts.
Apply one ensemble learning technique to see whether those techniques lead to a better performance than in task 1 and task 2.
